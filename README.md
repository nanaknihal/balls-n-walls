# balls-n-walls
balls-n-walls (a.k.a Robomb) is a game I built back in freshman year (under different github account) to gamify the psychological paradigm of multiple object tracking (MOT). It integrates with the jsPsych library for integration with psychology experiments.

It utilizes the MVC design pattern. 

For some irrational reason, I decided against advice to build it from scratch in Javascript with an HTML canvas, instead of using existing physics engines... 'twas a learning experience
